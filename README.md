# DAND_p2_openstreetmap

The project required that you download a dataset from OpenStreetMap and use data wrangling/munging
techniques to assess the quality of the data and make improvement where necessary. Once the data is
audited and cleaned, the data was then to be loaded into either SQL or MongoDB database and queried
to discover insights.

The goal of the project was to demonstrate the student's ability to:
  * Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity
  * Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .json, .xml, .csv, .html
  * Process data from many files and very large files that can be cleaned with spreadsheet programs
  * Learn how to store, query and aggregate data using mongoDB or SQL


The OSM data chosen for this project is an extracted may of the city of Vancouver, BC, Canada.
